A sample of the projects I would've encountered in my previous experience(s) and how the issues were faced and challenged. The scripts here are documented code and can be explored with features highlighted and commented on for a thorough understanding of the scripts.

A comment on the context of the reports that are also a part of this repository:

- The 'Service Requests Resolutions' script was an exercise that required an appreciable amount of effort in PowerBI and Power Query to enable interactivity based on conditions for calculated fields based on records counted in the input file that had to be expressed dynamically as in the 1st, 3rd and 5th-page graphics using such functions as SELECTEDVALUES, FILTER, CALCULATE, COUNTROWS to capture same.

- The 'JAM_Textblast_Analysis' is an analysis representing the monitoring dashboard associated with the output of a classification exercise the basis of which was to select customers for text-based campaigns based on purchase history and support/confidence levels between products by employing machine learning, data scrubbing and SQL scripting in Python to access tables and data compression using dask dataframes as well as principal component analysis (PCA) in the ending stages of the study to improve on accuracy of output model.

- 'The Campaign Analysis Dashboard' provides an overlay of the initial design and thought processes behind the creation of the aptly named analysis, and displays the requirement for communicating complex ideas to an audience that would ideally be decision-makers and initiators of new processes who would require some level of convincing.

- Notebook 1 comprises a visualization that was developed for a telecommunication kaggle dataset incorporating churn analysis, segmentation and revenue. The analysis is composed of two sections; an Executive Dashboard and an Operational Insight Dashboard and serves to maximize the information capture given the diversity of the data while having a sleek, minimalist design that can easily be filtered on for deep-drill down over a swath of customer attributes that serve as the base for profitability in part by reducing churn and obtaining more "value-added" by segment.
